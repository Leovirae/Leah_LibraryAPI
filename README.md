# Library API

The Library API is a robust backend service designed to manage a library's resources efficiently. It provides endpoints to manage books, authors, users, and borrowing records. The API uses JWT authentication for secure access and token management to enhance security.

## Features

- **JWT Authentication**: Secure access to the API with JSON Web Tokens.
- **Token Revocation**: Ensures tokens are valid for only one use, enhancing security.
- **CRUD Operations**: Manage users, authors, book, and book-author relationships.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages for better debugging and client understanding.

## Technologies Used

- **PHP**: Core backend logic using the Slim framework.
- **Slim Framework**: Lightweight and fast framework for PHP.
- **Firebase JWT**: Library for handling JSON Web Tokens.
- **PSR-7**: HTTP message interfaces for standardized request and response handling.

## Authentication (JWT)

### Overview

The API uses JWT for secure authentication:
- Clients must include a token in the `Authorization` header of each request.
- Tokens are validated, and revoked after a single use to prevent reuse.
- Revoked tokens are tracked using PHP sessions.

### Token Management

- **Generation**: Tokens are generated after successful login.
- **Validation**: Middleware ensures the token is valid and not expired.
- **Revocation**: Tokens are invalidated after their first use.
